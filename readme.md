## Summary

Your task is to create a full stack web application which utilizes a free, public API to pull data from
and to display that data in the form of a table in the UI. Your backend should access the public API and your frontend should access the backend you set up.

### Requirements

- Application should be full stack.

- A server built with Node.js. All other library and framework choices are up to you.

- Data is pulled from a public API. (Here is an example of the type of API you can use https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies)

- A UI which displays data in a table. This data is retrieved from your server.

- Some sort of filter functionality on the table. This should filter the data client-side and show the filtered data.

- Send us back a link to a git repository with your finished project. There is no requirement to host your finished project.

### Optional suggestions

- Implement pagination, rows per page, or search functionality of your chosen endpoint with query strings or URL params.

- Make the UI look like a full web page, however the bare minimum is just a table.
